      Harar is known as the fourth holiest city in Islam and has been a center

      back to the 7th century, making it one of the oldest cities in Africa. The
      city's unique blend of Islamic, African, and European influences has
      shaped its distinctive architecture, traditions, and way of life.

    <h2>The Magic of Harari Culture</h2>

      The Harari people, the indigenous inhabitants of Harar, have a rich
      cultural heritage that is proudly preserved and celebrated. From their
      unique language to their traditional music, dance, and cuisine, the Harari
      culture is a vibrant tapestry woven with centuries of tradition.

      Harari homes adorned with intricately carved wooden doors and colorful
      paintings. The Harari people are known for their craftsmanship,
      particularly in the art of pottery, weaving, and basketry. Traditional
      markets, such as the famous Jugol Market, offer a glimpse into the local
      way of life and provide an opportunity to interact with the friendly
      Harari people.

      In addition to its rich history and culture, Harar is home to several
      notable landmarks and attractions. The Harar Museum provides an in-depth
      look into the city's past, showcasing artifacts, manuscripts, and cultural

      No visit to Harar would be complete without experiencing the daily hyena
      feeding ritual. In the outskirts of the city, local "hyena men" hand-feed
      hyenas every night, a tradition that has been passed down through
      generations. Witnessing this ancient practice up close is both thrilling
      and awe-inspiring.
